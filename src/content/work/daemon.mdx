## Overview
Daemon was initially concepted for a senior-design project as part of Michigan State Univeristy's Game Design and Development minor.
The initial mostly-complete version of the game was created by a core team of around 15 students in a single semester with the ambitious goal set of making a fully playable and truly fun online multiplayer experience. 
Daemon served as both an excellent showcase of the each individual's skills up to that point and a great learning opportunity in developing, testing, and publishing an online multiplayer game.
Since one of the main goals of the project was to create a multiplayer title that any player could pick up and immediately enjoy, we were inspired by existing games and modes like Flashpoint in Overwatch and Hardpoint in Call of Duty.
Daemon expands on the easily-understood mechanics of a capture-the-point style game mode by allowing players to create custom tactical and expressive loadouts via the "create-a-class" Armory and Build Credits systems.
