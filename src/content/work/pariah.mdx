## Overview
Pariah was worked on by a group of 8 people over 6 weeks. Pariah is a 3D isometric roguelike in which the player takes the role of a capybara. The beloved capybara is thrown into a hellish tournament- mercilessly forced to fight to the death. Hack and slash through rounds of enemies, collect upgrades and abilities, and fight your way to victory in Pariah!

## Technical Contributions
I was responsible for creating a flexible upgrade system for the game that would allow me to implement any particular upgrade that our designers came up with.

While it did work for the game we made, I have a lot of thoughts in retrospect on how the system could be made much better, as it was certainly flawed. At the least, it was a good learning experience.
