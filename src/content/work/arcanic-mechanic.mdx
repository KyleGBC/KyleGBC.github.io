## Overview
Arcanic Mechanic was concepted as a game where the player must craft unique guns out of enemy drops to create eccentric effects through a crazy amount of combinations.
Similar to my other projects, it was created by a small group of people over a very short time span. 
This was the first game I've worked on in the first person shooter genre, and was the impetus for <a href='/work/project-mercury'>Project Mercury</a>, as that game was initially a re-creation in Unreal Engine as a way to learn that engine.


## Technical Contributions
On Arcanic Mechanic, I was primarly focused on creating satisifying movement. 
Drawing from my love for Source Engine games and Titanfall 2, I created a first person controller with wall-running as well as intentionally introducing the same bug logic that allowed for well-known air-strafing and bunny-hopping movement techniques.
