## Contents

## Overview
Welcome to the radical streets of Fast Food 2: Even Faster. Sit down with a buddy as you take control of an ice cream truck with a  broken freezer. One of you will man the helm while the other will take charge of the treat cannon. Deliver as much ice cream as you can before it all melts and save the summer!

## Technical Contributions
For Fast Food 2: Even Faster, I tried my hand at working on a road-generation system. While the became out of scope for the project, I still worked on a basic traffic and pedestrian system that drove the dynamic cityscape that you drive through in the game.
