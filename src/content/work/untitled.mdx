## Overview
Untitled.exe was the first game I ever worked on in a team, and the first game I ever worked on in my game development minor.
It centers on you, a playtester who sits down to play a game, only for the game's narrator to tell you that some parts aren't finished, and ask for your help.
As the playtester, you must draw in game assets in order to complete the puzzle and uncover the narrator's troubled backstory.

## Technical Contributions
I worked on a variety of small gameplay tasks for Untitled, but my most significant contribution is the complete, quite fun, and challenging final boss fight against the narrator themselves.
